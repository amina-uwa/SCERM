Hey Brendan,
This is a sim that is mostly ready to run whilst I am at sea.
It needs a .nml file that Matt should give you with the AED-Land module and it also needs to have the AED settings in the fvc control file changed.
Thus far I havent had much luck getting cells to dry out again so can you also check if the cell wet/dry limits are reasonable for a flooding sim?
Cheers,
Chris
